So this is my personal GitHub page. So far, I only used this to get familiar with Jekyll and GitHub pages. However, I hope to post some more relevant content in the future.

This post might be edited a few times to test some basic things like [including an image](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#including-images-and-resources).

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/screenshot.png" width="100%" alt="including an image" />

Markdown not allowing to set an image's size is kind of annoying, but there's still good old html...
