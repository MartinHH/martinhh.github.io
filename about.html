  <h1>About this blog</h1>

  This is my personal GitHub page.

  So far, it is just a testbed for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), but I might soon start posting some more stuff that will be at least slightly related to software development. Also, I might post some more information about myself right here on this page.
